    Return coordinate matrices from two or more coordinate vectors.

    Make N-D coordinate arrays for vectorized evaluations of
    N-D scalar/vector fields over N-D grids, given
    one-dimensional coordinate arrays x1, x2,..., xn.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x1, x2,..., xn : array_like
        1-D arrays representing the coordinates of a grid.
    indexing : {'xy', 'ij'}, optional
        Cartesian ('xy', default) or matrix ('ij') indexing of output.
        See Notes for more details.
    sparse : bool, optional
         If True a sparse grid is returned in order to conserve memory.
         Default is False.
    copy : bool, optional
        If False, a view into the original arrays are returned in
        order to conserve memory.  Default is True.  Please note that
        ``sparse=False, copy=False`` will likely return non-contiguous arrays.
        Furthermore, more than one element of a broadcast array may refer to
        a single memory location.  If you need to write to the arrays, make
        copies first.

    Returns
    -------
    X1, X2,..., XN : ndarray
        For vectors `x1`, `x2`,..., 'xn' with lengths ``Ni=len(xi)`` ,
        return ``(N1, N2, N3,...Nn)`` shaped arrays if indexing='ij'
        or ``(N2, N1, N3,...Nn)`` shaped arrays if indexing='xy'
        with the elements of `xi` repeated to fill the matrix along
        the first dimension for `x1`, the second for `x2` and so on.

    Notes
    -----
    This function supports both indexing conventions through the indexing keyword
    argument.  Giving the string 'ij' returns a meshgrid with matrix indexing,
    while 'xy' returns a meshgrid with Cartesian indexing.  In the 2-D case
    with inputs of length M and N, the outputs are of shape (N, M) for 'xy'
    indexing and (M, N) for 'ij' indexing.  In the 3-D case with inputs of
    length M, N and P, outputs are of shape (N, M, P) for 'xy' indexing and (M,
    N, P) for 'ij' indexing.  The difference is illustrated by the following
    code snippet::

        xv, yv = meshgrid(x, y, sparse=False, indexing='ij')
        for i in range(nx):
            for j in range(ny):
                # treat xv[i,j], yv[i,j]

        xv, yv = meshgrid(x, y, sparse=False, indexing='xy')
        for i in range(nx):
            for j in range(ny):
                # treat xv[j,i], yv[j,i]

    Examples
    --------
    >>> nx, ny = (3, 2)
    >>> x = np.linspace(0, 1, nx)
    >>> y = np.linspace(0, 1, ny)
    >>> xv, yv = meshgrid(x, y)
    >>> xv
    array([[ 0. ,  0.5,  1. ],
           [ 0. ,  0.5,  1. ]])
    >>> yv
    array([[ 0.,  0.,  0.],
           [ 1.,  1.,  1.]])
    >>> xv, yv = meshgrid(x, y, sparse=True)  # make sparse output arrays
    >>> xv
    array([[ 0. ,  0.5,  1. ]])
    >>> yv
    array([[ 0.],
           [ 1.]])

    `meshgrid` is very useful to evaluate functions on a grid.

    >>> x = np.arange(-5, 5, 0.1)
    >>> y = np.arange(-5, 5, 0.1)
    >>> xx, yy = meshgrid(x, y, sparse=True)
    >>> z = np.sin(xx**2 + yy**2) / (xx**2 + yy**2)
    >>> h = plt.contourf(x,y,z)
